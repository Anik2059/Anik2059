👋 Hi, I’m @Anik2059
I’m Md. Hasibul Islam, a passionate student from Green University of Bangladesh, working on innovative projects like MJ Shopping—an online shopping platform to make e-commerce easy and sustainable.

👀 I’m interested in web development, e-commerce solutions, and sustainable tech. I love building user-friendly platforms that solve real-world problems, like affordable shopping and supporting local vendors.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud computing with AWS to scale MJ Shopping for 500+ users, along with advanced JavaScript and React.js to improve our platform’s features like multi-store orders.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on e-commerce projects, open-source web apps, or sustainability-focused tech. If you’re interested in enhancing MJ Shopping or starting something new, let’s connect!
