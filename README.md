👋 Hey there,
I’m Md. Hasibul Islam, a super excited student at Green University of Bangladesh, working on awesome projects that make life easier. My biggest project is MJ Shopping, an online shopping platform I helped create to make e-commerce simple, affordable, and eco-friendly. I also built a cool chat program with Python, Tkinter, and sockets—it’s like a mini WhatsApp for your computer, letting people chat instantly!
👀 I’m into web development, e-commerce, and sustainable tech. I love making platforms that help people, like connecting local vendors to customers or creating greener ways to shop. Networking is my jam too—I’m always tinkering with ways to make systems talk to each other, like in my chat program!
🌱  I’m jumping into the hottest trends: exploring blockchain to power MJ Shopping with secure, transparent transactions, diving into cryptography to lock down data like a pro, and tweaking Python to make my chat program a next-level, crypto-secure beast!
💞️ Wanna team up? I’m down to collaborate on e-commerce stuff, open-source web projects, or anything eco-friendly. If you’ve got ideas to level up MJ Shopping, improve my chat program, or start something new, let’s chat!

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge Cristiano Ronaldo fan and a die-hard Real Madrid supporter! When I’m not coding MJ Shopping or my chat program, I’m cheering for Ronaldo’s goals or watching Real Madrid crush it.
Thanks for checking out my profile! Peek at my repos, and let’s build something epic together! 😎
